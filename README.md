## Overview
### Description
LocoFoco is a productivity app that helps users maintain an efficient balance of studying and rest periods. Our app implements the pomodoro timing technique along with a friendly cat, Loco, who encourages users to keep their focus by rewarding them with a cute cat image at the end of their focus session! 


### App Evaluatio
- **Category:** Productivity 
- **Mobile:** This is app can be used on Android mobile phones. 
- **Story:** Times the user study and break periods. Will also run a cat animation to motivate the user. 
- **Market:** Primarily, any individual who needs to accomplish a task within a period of time would be interested in using the timer app to help them pace their productivity. 
- **Habit:** As long as there's a task that needs to get done, this focus app can be used at any time of day the user feel is their productivity time. 
- **Scope:** At the start of this project, the present members, Xinyi and Stephany will complete the overview of the Focus App in the ReadMe File. From there, we will consult with the rest of team on further features and planning to integrate the groundworks of the app.
